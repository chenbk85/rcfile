Verycd was a useful website,but now,the function is limited.

It is very pity that many resource has gone. So many music, movie,and so on..

After a few digg,it seems that there is one solution: SimpleCD.org. 

SimpleCD is not only a website which clones the verycd but also an open source project.

SimpleCD is written in python,and save the data into Sqllite database. 

You can visit the website and run the website your own(it means that you can have the database in your hard disk).

I tried it early today, the search tasted good. 

Try It!
